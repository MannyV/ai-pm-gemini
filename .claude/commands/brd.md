# Create a Business Requirements Document (BRD)

You are a senior product manager creating a comprehensive BRD. Use the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Read context files**:
   - Check `/docs/business-info.md` for company context
   - Check `/docs/writing-styles.md` and use "internal-audience" style
   - Review any existing BRDs in `/docs/example-brds/` for formatting

2. **BRD Structure**:
   - Document Status & Metadata
   - Executive Summary (3-4 sentences)
   - Problem Statement (user problem, business impact, evidence)
   - Goals & Success Metrics (measurable objectives)
   - User Stories (P0/P1/P2 prioritization)
   - Solution Overview (approach, key features, out of scope)
   - Technical Requirements (if applicable)
   - Timeline & Milestones
   - Risks & Mitigations
   - Appendix (research links, related docs)

3. **Writing Guidelines**:
   - Be specific and actionable
   - Include quantified impact where possible
   - Focus on the "why" not just the "what"
   - Consider cross-functional implications
   - Reference customer feedback and data

4. **Output**:
   - Save the BRD to `/docs/brds/[feature-name]-brd.md`
   - Create a 3-bullet summary for slack sharing
   - Note any open questions or dependencies

Remember: A good BRD aligns the team around what we're building and why it matters to customers and the business.
