Elena: OK team lets dive into our Q2 objectives based on what were hearing from customers. Michael can you kick us off with support insights?

Michael: Absolutely. The dominant pattern is initial setup friction. Im personally investing four to five hours with each new account just to help them build their first process. Everyone wants starter templates or some kind of guided beginning.

Jordan: This is destroying our close rates. Demos go great but the moment we mention six week implementation timelines prospects hesitate. FlowCompete is advertising five day setups with their template library.

Alex: From engineering this isnt a quick fix. Wed need versioning support customization hooks and proper validation. My guess is three to four sprint cycles.

Morgan: Ive been prototyping some concepts actually. What if we keep it minimal initially maybe six templates covering the most frequent patterns? Could ship an MVP in a single sprint.

Elena: I like the pragmatic approach. Michael which six would you prioritize?

Michael: Looking at our usage analytics. New hire workflows. Purchase authorization. Client feedback loops. Asset tracking. Contract reviews. Those represent roughly seventy percent of what people build first.

Alex: If we constrain it to those six and avoid complexity we could deliver in one sprint. No advanced features though just functional templates they can adapt.

Elena: Done. Alex can your team commit to Sprint eighteen?

Alex: If Morgan delivers designs by Wednesday yes.

Morgan: Wireframes by Tuesday complete specs by Friday.

Jordan: This will unlock significant pipeline. Could we build a community template library eventually where customers publish their workflows?

Elena: Interesting for later phases. For now lets nail these six first. Whats the next priority?

Michael: Mobile capabilities. Ive got roughly twelve accounts flagging churn risk because their field teams cant access the platform remotely.

Alex: Thats a substantial undertaking. Native mobile apps would require four to five months easily.

Morgan: Have we considered a progressive web app approach? We could deliver basic viewing and modification capabilities in seven weeks.

Alex: If we limit scope to view modify and execute workflows a PWA is viable. Defer workflow creation on mobile for later.

Elena: Lets move forward with that. Any mobile access beats no mobile access. Jordan would this address the field service opportunities?

Jordan: Completely. Read only mode helps but lightweight editing capability is ideal.

Elena: Alright our Q2 plan. Six core templates Sprint eighteen. PWA mobile Sprints nineteen through twenty one. Anything else urgent?

Michael: Reporting and metrics. Customers struggle to justify our cost to leadership. They need visualizations demonstrating time savings productivity improvements and ROI.

Alex: We capture that data already its just not presented effectively. Primarily a frontend challenge.

Morgan: I could design a metrics dashboard alongside the other initiatives. Probably two sprint effort?

Elena: Schedule that for Sprints twenty through twenty one after template launch. Other pressing items?

Jordan: Communication platform connectivity. Nearly every deal discussion includes questions about it.

Alex: Straightforward implementation maybe one sprint using their automation APIs.

Elena: Perfect add that to Sprint nineteen. So Q2 roadmap recap Sprint eighteen template system six templates. Sprint nineteen communication integration. Sprints nineteen through twenty one mobile PWA. Sprints twenty through twenty one reporting dashboard.

Michael: This addresses roughly eighty five percent of my escalation queue. Really looking forward to seeing this delivered.

Jordan: Agreed. This plan would clear approximately two point five million in stalled opportunities.

Alex: Ambitious timeline but achievable if we maintain focus. Elena can you finalize specifications?

Elena: Ill have BRDs for templates and mobile completed by Friday. Morgan lets connect tomorrow about design sequencing.

Morgan: Works for me. Ill begin template mockups this afternoon.

Elena: Excellent session team. Status check next week. Action items I need to complete BRD for template library by Friday. Draft BRD for mobile PWA by Friday. Calendar design coordination with Morgan for tomorrow. Finalize requirements to avoid expansion.

Morgan: Ill develop template wireframes by Tuesday. Finish template specifications by Friday. Begin mobile PWA design exploration.

Alex: Ill scope technical requirements for communication integration. Assign engineers to template development. Evaluate PWA technology options and limitations.

Michael: Ill compile detailed template specifications from customer usage patterns. Recruit beta participants for template validation. Catalog typical customization needs.

Jordan: Ill prepare sales materials for template offering. List prospects waiting on mobile functionality. Calculate revenue impact of Q2 initiatives.

Elena: Follow up scheduled for February fifteenth to assess progress.
