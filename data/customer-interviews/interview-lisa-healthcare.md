## Interview Transcript

**Interviewer:** Lisa, thanks for making time. Could you walk us through HealthBridge and your responsibilities?

**Lisa:** Absolutely. HealthBridge is a regional medical network with 15 facilities serving roughly 60,000 patients annually. My job is optimizing workflows and efficiency across all our sites. We brought in your platform about eight months ago, primarily for patient registration, scheduling coordination, and benefits verification processes.

**Interviewer:** What's your assessment so far?

**Lisa:** The back-end efficiency gains have been significant. Our benefits verification process went from nearly an hour per patient down to under 20 minutes. That said, we're bumping up against some serious limitations that are preventing us from expanding usage.

**Interviewer:** What kinds of limitations?

**Lisa:** Primarily around regulatory requirements and audit readiness. In healthcare, everything needs a paper trail. We have to demonstrate HIPAA compliance, show exactly who touched what data and when, maintain approval hierarchies. Your system handles the work beautifully, but when auditors come calling, I can't easily show them what they need.

**Interviewer:** Could you walk me through a specific situation?

**Lisa:** Sure. Three weeks ago during our quarterly compliance review, the auditor requested complete documentation of our patient data handling - access logs, modification timestamps, approval workflows, the whole nine yards. My operations team spent nearly three days piecing together exports and screenshots to build that documentation. That's something that should be instantly available.

**Interviewer:** What would an ideal compliance solution look like to you?

**Lisa:** Automated compliance reporting that traces the complete journey of any workflow execution. HIPAA-compliant audit logging as a standard feature. Permission controls that are easy to configure and document. Essentially, I need to demonstrate regulatory compliance without manual detective work.

**Interviewer:** Are there other healthcare-specific hurdles?

**Lisa:** Absolutely. Connecting with our electronic health record systems is a nightmare. We're running Epic at our main campus, Cerner at satellite locations. Every integration requires custom development work. Pre-configured healthcare connectors would be transformative.

**Interviewer:** How does that integration gap affect daily operations?

**Lisa:** Staff end up copying data manually between platforms. That creates room for errors and burns time. We're automating certain processes but still have people doing data entry, which undermines the whole value proposition.

**Interviewer:** What about your medical staff's interaction with the system?

**Lisa:** Truth be told, most physicians and nurses don't touch it directly. The workflows are too abstract to modify on the fly, and they don't have bandwidth for training. My ops team designs everything, then shows clinical staff just their specific touchpoints. It functions, but there's definitely room for improvement.

**Interviewer:** How could we better serve clinical users?

**Lisa:** Role-tailored interfaces would help tremendously. Nurses should only see nursing workflows, presented in clinical language they recognize instantly. Voice interaction would be incredible too - they're often juggling multiple tasks with patients.

**Interviewer:** How are you tracking impact and success?

**Lisa:** We monitor patient throughput times, benefits approval success rates, and administrative labor hours. Your platform provides some metrics, but I'm constantly merging that with EMR data and manual tracking. What I really need is unified healthcare analytics.

**Interviewer:** Which metrics matter most to you?

**Lisa:** Patient experience scores, regulatory compliance indicators, revenue cycle acceleration, and staff productivity. I want clear visibility into how operational improvements translate to better patient outcomes and financial performance.

**Interviewer:** Has the investment paid off?

**Lisa:** Without question. We've cut administrative overtime by a third and boosted benefits approval rates by 18%. But the compliance overhead and integration friction are keeping us from capturing the full value potential.

**Interviewer:** If you had three feature requests, what would top your list?

**Lisa:**
1. Healthcare compliance toolkit - automated audit trails, HIPAA controls, instant compliance documentation
2. Native integrations with major EMR platforms
3. Industry-specific workflow templates built by people who understand medical operations

**Interviewer:** Tell me more about the templates idea.

**Lisa:** Every medical practice needs patient registration, appointment coordination, prescription management, lab results distribution. These aren't generic business processes - they have unique healthcare compliance and workflow requirements. Expert-designed templates would eliminate months of implementation time.

**Interviewer:** How do we stack up against healthcare-native platforms?

**Lisa:** Healthcare-specific tools understand compliance but lack customization flexibility. Your platform offers flexibility but requires us to build healthcare features ourselves. You're about 75% of the way there - just needs that healthcare specialization layer.

**Interviewer:** What about patient-facing capabilities?

**Lisa:** That's an interesting angle. Currently everything is staff-oriented. But patient engagement features - appointment prep tracking, digital intake forms, automated reminders - would be transformational. Making it patient-centered, not just provider-centered.

**Interviewer:** Any concerns about our long-term fit for healthcare?

**Lisa:** My main worry is that you'll stay generalized and we'll eventually need to migrate to a healthcare-dedicated solution. But if you invest in healthcare capabilities, we'd be committed long-term partners. Your core technology is exceptional.

**Interviewer:** Any closing thoughts?

**Lisa:** Healthcare is complicated, but the market opportunity is enormous. Every medical practice in the country faces these exact challenges. Execute well on healthcare features, and you'll revolutionize clinical operations. We're eager to collaborate - beta programs, design partnerships, whatever accelerates this vision.
